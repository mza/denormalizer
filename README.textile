h1.The Denormalizer

The Denormalizer extends ActiveRecord to allow for easy denormalization of attributes (real and computed) from one model to another.

h2.Installation

Those rolling on Edge Rails can grab the plugin directly from the git repository:

./script/plugin install http://github.com/mza/denormalizer

Otherwise, clone the plugin in to the vendor/plugins folder to get started:

git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/mza/denormalizer.git vendor/plugins/denormalizer

h3.Denormalizing

The Denormalizer arranges for attributes on one model to be saved as an attribute on a related model. This allows for faster queries,
since relationship trees don't have to be fully loaded to retrieve the values. It can also save the results of a model's method to the
database, again, to prevent multiple queries and heavy requests.
