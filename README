Denormalizer
============

The Denormalizer extends ActiveRecord to allow for easy denormalization of attributes (real and computed) from one model to another.

Installation

Those rolling on Edge Rails can grab the plugin directly from the git repository:

./script/plugin install http://github.com/mza/denormalizer

Otherwise, clone the plugin in to the vendor/plugins folder to get started:

git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/mza/denormalizer.git vendor/plugins/denormalizer
